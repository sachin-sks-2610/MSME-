⚡ Quick Start

### System Requirements
**Minimum:**
- Node.js: 16 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Browser: Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Firefox 88+

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js 16+ with npm/yarn

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SANJEEVNATHCP/Taxcalm---AI-Powered-MSME-Assistance.git
    cd Taxcalm---AI-Powered-MSME-Assistance
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the dashboard folder**:
    ```bash
    cd taxcalm-dashboard
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open in Browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in your terminal)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist/` folder.

### Running Legacy Backend (Optional - Local Only)

> **Note**: The legacy backend is NOT included in the GitHub repository. It's kept locally for development only.

If you have the `legacy_backend/` folder available locally:

1.  **Navigate to legacy backend**:
    ```bash
    cd legacy_backend
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Start the Flask server**:
    ```bash
    python flask_app.py
    ```
    The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

## 📦 Building & Deployment

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in `taxcalm-dashboard/` for optional configuration:

```
# Optional: Only needed if running legacy Flask backend locally
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The frontend works perfectly **without** this - all data is stored locally in the browser.

## 🗂️ Legacy Backend (Local Only)

> **⚠️ Important**: The `legacy_backend/` folder is **NOT** included in the GitHub repository. It's archived locally on the development machine for reference and future development.

**What was in the legacy backend:**
- Flask REST API
- Zoom scheduler integration  
- Finance calculations engine
- Blender addon for 3D visualizations
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- Database configurations
- Old static files (HTML/CSS/JS)

### Why was it removed from GitHub?
- Reduces repository size significantly (~60MB+)
- Keeps the repository focused on the current Vite frontend
- Legacy code is available locally for developers who need it
- Frontend app is fully functional as a standalone web application

---

## 🎮 Performance & GPU Acceleration

The current Vite-based frontend is optimized for performance:
- ⚡ **Lightning-fast builds** with Vite
- 🚀 **React optimization** with lazy loading
- 📊 **Smooth animations** with CSS & JS transitions
- 💻 **Browser-native hardware acceleration** via WebGL

For extreme computational workload requirements, GPU.js integration is available in the legacy backend.
